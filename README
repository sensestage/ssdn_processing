Processing Sense/Stage DataNetwork Client.


Drag the folder to the libraries folder:

    For Processing 1.0 the libraries folder is located in your Processing sketch folder.
    For Processing BETA the libraries folder is in the same folder as the Processing application.

Now, if you start up Processing, you will see the library appear in the File->Sketchbook->libraries. You will find four examples there to start rightaway!
